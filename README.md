# Data Analytics For Climate Change Resolution And Sustainable Development

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the [**Independent Study**](https://kampusmerdeka.kemdikbud.go.id/program/studi-independen/detail) program titled **Data Analytics For Climate Change Resolution And Sustainable Development** at [**PT Zenius**](https://www.zenius.net/), held by the [**Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology**](https://www.kemdikbud.go.id/main/). Throughout this program, I completed several **assignments** and **final projects**. I will briefly describe each assignment and final project below:

## Assignments
1. [**Syntax Code Python Exploratory Data Analysis**](https://github.com/dinann1990/Zenius/blob/main/Assessment/Assessment_1_Perdinan_Daud_Panggabean.ipynb) - In this assignment, I used Data Analysis of Natural Disasters and Climate Change data from Kaggle to create advanced visualizations using Python. I received a score of 96/100 for this assignment.

2. [**Comprehensive Analysis on Carbon Dioxide Levels and Climate Change**](https://github.com/dinann1990/Zenius/blob/main/Assessment/Assessment_2_Perdinan_Daud_Panggabean.ipynb) - In this assignment, I used the Carbon Dioxide | Vital Signs data from Climate NASA (https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/) to perform Descriptive and Inferential Statistics to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Statistical Modeling using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. using Python. I received a score of 96/100 for this assignment.

3. [**Comprehensive Analysis on Climate Data**](https://github.com/dinann1990/Zenius/blob/main/Assessment/Assessment_3_Perdinan_Daud_Panggabean.ipynb) - In this assignment, I used the Exploratory-data-analysis-of-climate-change-and-natural-disasters data from Kaggle to perform classification using PostgreSQL, various algorithms including logistic regression, KNN, Descriptive and Inferential Statistics, EDA, and Statistical Modeling, and random forest. I received a score of 93/100 for this assignment.

## Final Projects
1. [**Final Project**](https://github.com/dinann1990/Zenius/blob/main/Final_Project/Final_Project_Kelompok_32.ipynb) - In this final project, Zenius Independent Study Final Project, we were grouped from various fields, including UI/UX and Product Management. Our objective was to create a solution or innovation for Climate Change. Our team, Group 32, innovated an Eco-Friendly E-Commerce Application. This application facilitates the buying and selling of recycled waste or saving waste to exchange for points, which can help in environmental conservation.
   
   As data analysts, our task was to find datasets related to our application, extract valuable insights from the data, and create a dashboard about our application (https://github.com/dinann1990/Zenius/tree/main/Final_Project/Dataset), and dashboard 
(https://github.com/dinann1990/Zenius/tree/main/Final_Project/Dashboard_Final_Project).

   For this final project, we utilized Descriptive and Inferential Statistics, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical Modeling, and Forecasting. The forecasting was focused on reducing Carbon Dioxide emissions through our application.
